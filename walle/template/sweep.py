NOTES
For runs that are not part of a sweep, the values of wandb.config are usually set by providing a dictionary 
to the config argument of wandb.init. During a sweep, however, any configuration information passed to wandb.init 
is instead treated as a default value, which might be over-ridden by the sweep.
